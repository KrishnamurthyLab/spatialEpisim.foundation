Description: Spatial epidemic simulations using SVEIRD compartmental
    epidemic models (Susceptible, Vaccinated, Exposed, Infected,
    Recovered, Dead) allow the mathematical modelling of epidemics using
    traditional, modified SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered)
    compartmental models as invented by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927.
    Spatial dynamics extend the SVEIRD modelling process in this software.
    'spatialEpisim' is a 'Shiny' application built on this
    'spatialEpisim.foundation'. The sources originated there, and now live
    here to provide for further validation and documenation through
    vignettes, tests, et cetera.
